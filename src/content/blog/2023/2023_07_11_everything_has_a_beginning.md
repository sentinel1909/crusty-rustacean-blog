Welcome!

_"Everything has a small beginning."_ - Marcus Tullius Cicero

Welcome to my newsletter. On the sign-up page, you probably saw the shamelessly ripped-off quote from the character Newt, in the 1986 classic, Aliens. I hope to write something of value on a mostly monthly basis. We'll see how that goes. I'm purposely trying to set the bar a bit low. Content creation is difficult for me. I hope I can change that with this "publication".

My newsletter will focus on the Rust programming language, which I discovered in early 2021. I fell in love with Rust's mission statement, "A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software", almost immediately. I wanted to learn to program again, to create something from nothing, but I wanted a reliable, robust, and supportive tool to achieve that goal.

I dabbled with a lot of tools in the early days of my "re-learn to code" journey. Somehow I always came back to Rust.

The tools are powerful and supportive, and the warmth and friendliness of the community is simply stunning.

It's an amazing thing that's growing to quietly take the world by storm, the hope that software can be performant, reliable, and productive. We no longer need to choose one or the other.

I'm an engineer, but not a software engineer. Even so, I've come to feel that every engineer should know how to code, to express a solution to a problem or build simple tools to benefit their workplace. I've put this notion to good effect in my career, making a simple intranet site and database search tool for the office where I work. I didn't make this in Rust, but hope eventually to convert it over.

I grew up around computers and have been...obsessed with them all my life. Rightly or wrongly, my world revolves around computers and information technology. I know how to code, but not for this modern, internet-enabled era. Some of the topics I plan to write on may be old hat for you, but hopefully, I'll be able to deliver some tiny slice of fresh perspective that you haven't thought about yet.

Please feel free to return to my newsletter sign-up page and use the contact form to send me feedback on any aspect of my writing. My voice will more than likely morph and change as I travel on this journey. My perspective may, more often than not in the beginning, be too basic for you. Please tell me. I'm infamous for running before I walk, tackling things that I really shouldn't, yet, and this may lead me to gloss over important details. Please tell me.

I want to create something that helps people and I want to create an environment where we can all learn from each other.

There is a blog link back on the newsletter sign-up page. The rough plan is to post to the newsletter first, with content then archived via the blog.

Thanks for reading and I'm looking forward to diving into some Rust content and sharing my perspective!

The end of August is rapidly upon us. Today we have a fresh release of Rust to enjoy.

[Announcing Rust 1.72.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/24/Rust-1.72.0.html)

An important note is provided near the end of the announcement, regarding future Windows compatibility:

> In a future release we're planning to increase the minimum supported Windows version to 10. The accepted proposal in compiler MCP 651 is that Rust 1.75 will be the last to officially support Windows 7, 8, and 8.1. When Rust 1.76 is released in February 2024, only Windows 10 and later will be supported as tier-1 targets. This change will apply both as a host compiler and as a compilation target.

## Purpose

I've started the [How to Learn Rust](https://learning.accelerant.dev/how-to-learn-rust) course offered by Tim McNamara. I'm creating this Learning Journal as part of Week 0 tasks. Rather than create something totally separate, I'm incorporating these writings into my regular blogging here at the Crusty Rustacean.

## Learning Goals

- become proficient and self-sufficient in developing "full stack" applications with the Rust language

## My ideal job title in 3 years' time

- I'm not intending on changing careers, so I don't really have a job title I'm aspiring to

## People who might be interested in hearing about my progress

- anyone learning Rust

## Projects I would like to be able to write in 6 months

- finish Zero to Production in Rust, with Axum, and have it go live to serve out newsletter content

## Barriers that I might face

- wanting too know too much too fast
- running before I walk

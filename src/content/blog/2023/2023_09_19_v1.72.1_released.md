I'm really not sure what's happening to September, fall is almost upon us! Today we have a new point release for Rust.

[Announcing Rust 1.72.1](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/09/19/Rust-1.72.1.html)

As the team says, this release today solves a few regressions introduced in 1.72.0.

Happy building!

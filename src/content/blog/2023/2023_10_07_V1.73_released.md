September disappeared and here we are at the beginning of October. I can't believe it's been six weeks already since the last major Rust release. On Thursday this past week the Rust team dropped version 1.73.0.

As usual, The Rust Blog has the low down:

[Announcing Rust 1.73.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/10/05/Rust-1.73.0.html)

I've been minorly obsessed with X lately, why, I'm not sure. I think it's because I feel that's where an audience might be. When I write in my own space, it feels like I'm shouting into the void and not helping anyone.

I'm kind of done with X.

Going forward I will prioritize my own properties and content will go here first.
